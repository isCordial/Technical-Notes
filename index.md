This is my personal site. A place for research and study, personal pragmatism emphasized. Though hopefully I've left a few useful things for you.

Here you can find my blog and personal research notes on whatever I happen to be focused on.

## What have I been up to?
- ‚öîÔ∏è Preparing for the [NCAE 2025](My%20Notes/NCAE%202025%20Preparation%20üõ°Ô∏è/NCAE%202025.md) Cybergames.
- Learning IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tools: [Vagrant](My%20Notes/Unsorted/Vagrant.md) and [Ansible](My%20Notes/Unsorted/Ansible.md).
- Setting up these notes for compatibility with [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
- Learning [Continuous Integration and Delivery](My%20Notes/Unsorted/Continuous%20Integration%20and%20Delivery.md) with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
