# Ansible

> [!info]+ What is Ansible?
> **Ansible** is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation across multiple systems. It works by connecting to nodes (servers or devices) over SSH and executing tasks using **YAML-based playbooks** without requiring agents on the remote systems. Ansible is known for its simplicity, using a **declarative language** to describe desired states, and itâ€™s especially popular for managing Linux environments.
